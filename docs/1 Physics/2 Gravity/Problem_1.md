# Orbital Period and Orbital Radius – Exploring Kepler’s Third Law and Beyond

## Motivation

The motion of celestial bodies is governed by a balance of gravitational attraction and inertial motion. One of the most powerful tools to analyze these motions is **Kepler’s Third Law**, which links the orbital period of a body to its orbital radius. Originally derived from planetary observations, this law has since been grounded in Newtonian mechanics and generalized to all two-body orbital systems.

Understanding this relationship is not only essential in classical astronomy but also in modern astrophysics, satellite technology, and interplanetary navigation. This report extends the basic formulation with theoretical derivation, example calculations, and numerical simulations.

## 1. Theoretical Foundation

### 1.1 Newtonian Derivation of Kepler’s Third Law

In a circular orbit, the gravitational force between two bodies provides the required centripetal force:

$$
F_g = \frac{G M m}{r^2}, \quad F_c = m \frac{v^2}{r}
$$

Setting these equal:

$$
\frac{G M m}{r^2} = m \frac{v^2}{r}
$$

Canceling terms and solving for velocity:

$$
v = \sqrt{\frac{G M}{r}}
$$

Orbital period is the circumference divided by speed:

$$
T = \frac{2\pi r}{v} = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{r^3}{G M}}
$$

Squaring both sides:

$$
T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{G M} r^3
$$

This is the generalized form of **Kepler’s Third Law**.

### 1.2 Full Derivation of Kepler’s Third Law (T² Formula)

Starting with Newton’s Law of Gravitation:

$$
F = \frac{G M m}{r^2}
$$

This provides the centripetal force for circular motion:

$$
F = m \frac{v^2}{r}
$$

Equating the two:

$$
\frac{G M m}{r^2} = m \frac{v^2}{r}
\Rightarrow v^2 = \frac{G M}{r}
$$

The orbital period is:

$$
T = \frac{2\pi r}{v}
= 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{r^3}{G M}} \Rightarrow
T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{G M} r^3
$$

### 1.3 Kepler Verification using Planet Data

Using:

| Planet   | Radius $r$ (m) | Period $T$ (s) |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| Mercury  | $5.79 \times 10^{10}$ | $7.6 \times 10^6$ |
| Venus    | $1.082 \times 10^{11}$ | $1.94 \times 10^7$ |
| Earth    | $1.496 \times 10^{11}$ | $3.16 \times 10^7$ |
| Mars     | $2.279 \times 10^{11}$ | $5.94 \times 10^7$ |

The plot confirms a linear relationship between $T^2$ and $r^3$ as expected.

### 1.4 Using Kepler’s Law to Find Mass of Central Body

From the formula:

$$
T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 r^3}{G M} \Rightarrow M = \frac{4\pi^2 r^3}{G T^2}
$$

#### Mass of the Earth

Use Moon’s orbit:
- $r = 3.84 \times 10^8$ m
- $T = 27.3 \times 24 \times 3600$ s

$$
M = \frac{4\pi^2 (3.84 \times 10^8)^3}{6.674 \times 10^{-11} \cdot (2.36 \times 10^6)^2}
\approx 5.97 \times 10^{24} \text{ kg}
$$

#### Mass of the Sun

Use Earth’s orbit:
- $r = 1.496 \times 10^{11}$ m
- $T = 365.25 \times 24 \times 3600$ s

$$
M = \frac{4\pi^2 (1.496 \times 10^{11})^3}{6.674 \times 10^{-11} \cdot (3.156 \times 10^7)^2}
\approx 1.989 \times 10^{30} \text{ kg}
$$

### 1.2 Constants and Units

- $G = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, m^3 kg^{-1} s^{-2}$ — Gravitational constant  
- $M$ — Mass of the central body (e.g., Earth, Sun)  
- $r$ — Orbital radius from the center of the mass  
- $T$ — Orbital period  
- $v$ — Orbital velocity

## 3. Scientific Implications

- **Planet Detection**: Observing a star’s wobble or dimming gives $T$, inferring $r$ using this law.
- **Mass Estimation**: Rearranging the formula gives $M$ based on known $T$ and $r$.
- **Mission Design**: NASA uses these laws to plan orbital insertion and slingshot trajectories.
