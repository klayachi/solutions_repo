## Calculations

### Mean Time for 10 Oscillations
$$
\bar{T}_{10} = \frac{\sum T_i}{10} = \frac{114.6}{10} = 11.46\ \text{s}
$$

### Mean Time for 1 Oscillation
$$
\bar{T} = \frac{\bar{T}_{10}}{10} = 1.146\ \text{s}
$$

### Experimental Value of Gravitational Acceleration
Using:
$$
T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}} \Rightarrow g = \frac{4\pi^2 L}{T^2}
$$

Substitute:
$$
g = \frac{4\pi^2 \cdot 0.280}{(1.146)^2} = 8.97\ \text{m/s}^2
$$

---

## Uncertainty and Error

- Time uncertainty (range method):  
$$
\Delta T_{10} = \frac{11.67 - 11.23}{2} = 0.22\ \text{s} \Rightarrow \Delta T = \frac{0.22}{10} = 0.022\ \text{s}
$$

- Propagated uncertainty:
$$
\Delta g = g \cdot \sqrt{ \left(\frac{\Delta L}{L}\right)^2 + \left(2\cdot\frac{\Delta T}{T}\right)^2 }
$$

---

## Conclusion

The experimental value $g = 8.97\ \text{m/s}^2$ is reasonably close to the standard $g = 9.81\ \text{m/s}^2$, with an error margin of approximately 8.6%. This confirms the effectiveness of pendulum-based methods for estimating gravitational acceleration.

## Theoretical Background

Assuming small-angle approximation:

$$
T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}} \Rightarrow g = \frac{4\pi^2 L}{T^2}
$$

## Discussion

- Deviations from $g_{\text{standard}} = 9.81\ \text{m/s}^2$ may result from:
  - Slight deviation in initial angle from ideal small-angle assumption
  - Timing human reaction delay
  - Air resistance and friction at pivot point

---

## Conclusion

This experiment demonstrated a reliable method of estimating Earth's gravitational acceleration with household tools. Combining careful measurement with repeated trials and error analysis leads to meaningful scientific insights from simple physical systems.
