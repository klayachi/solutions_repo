Theoretical Foundation Projectile motion is governed by Newton's laws. The equations of motion for a projectile launched at an angle \\( \\theta \\) with initial velocity \\( v_0 \\) are derived from kinematic equations: Differential Equation of Motion The motion of a projectile is governed by the second-order differential equations: $$ \\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = 0, \\quad \\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} = -g $$ Integrating once: $$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = v_0 \\cos(\\theta), \\quad \\frac{dy}{dt} = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) - g t $$ Integrating again: $$ x(t) = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) t, \\quad y(t) = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 $$ Equations of Motion Horizontal displacement: $$ x(t) = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) t $$ Vertical displacement: $$ y(t) = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 $$ To find the range \\( R \\) , we determine the time of flight \\( T_f \\) : $$ T_f = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} $$ Substituting into the horizontal displacement: $$ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} $$ 2. Analysis of the Range The maximum range occurs at \\( \\theta = 45^\\circ \\) , yielding: $$ R_{\\max} = \\frac{v_0^2}{g} $$ Gravity Influence: Lower gravity increases range (e.g., Moon vs. Earth). Velocity Impact: Higher velocity increases range quadratically. 3. Practical Applications Sports: Ball trajectories in football and golf. Engineering: Optimizing projectile launch angles. Astrophysics: Calculating satellite orbits and probes. 4. Implementation The following Python script implements additional simulations based on professor's notes: import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from matplotlib.animation import FuncAnimation Function to calculate projectile trajectory def projectile_trajectory(v0, angle, g=9.81, h=0, dt=0.05): angle_rad = np.radians(angle) vx = v0 * np.cos(angle_rad) vy = v0 * np.sin(angle_rad) x, y = [0], [h] t = 0 while y[-1] >= 0: t += dt x.append(vx * t) y.append(h + vy * t - 0.5 * g * t**2) return np.array(x), np.array(y) Setting up the figure fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 5)) ax.set_xlim(0, 60) ax.set_ylim(0, 30) ax.set_xlabel(\"Horizontal Distance (m)\") ax.set_ylabel(\"Vertical Distance (m)\") ax.set_title(\"Projectile Motion Animation\") line, = ax.plot([], [], 'ro', markersize=6) # Red dot for projectile Simulating motion v0, angle = 20, 45 # Initial velocity and launch angle x_data, y_data = projectile_trajectory(v0, angle) Animation function def update(frame): if frame < len(x_data): line.set_data(x_data[frame], y_data[frame]) return line, Create animation ani = FuncAnimation(fig, update, frames=len(x_data), interval=50, blit=True) plt.show() ``` 5. Limitations and Future Work No Air Resistance (Basic Model): The extended model includes drag. Uneven Terrain: Not considered. Wind Effects: Future implementations could include wind effects. Future Enhancements More detailed models incorporating wind and other real-world effects.
